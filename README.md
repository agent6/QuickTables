# QuickTables 🚀
Master your multiplication tables with speed and accuracy!

QuickTables is a web-based app designed to help students practice multiplication facts from 0 to 12. With a built-in performance tracker and timed challenges, learners can build both confidence and speed in their math skills.

## 🎯 Features

- **On-Screen Numpad + Keyboard Support**  
- **Automatic Progression** — No need to press Enter if you're correct!  
- **Performance Tracker Matrix**  
   - 🟩 Green: Correct & Quick  
   - 🟨 Yellow: Correct but Slow  
   - ⬜ White: Not Practiced  
   - ⬛ Gray: Practiced but Unreliable  
- **Adjustable Time Per Question** (3s, 6s, 12s)  
- **90-Second Challenge Mode** with countdown timer  
- **Progress Saved Locally** (using LocalStorage)
